⚙️🛠️ Backend: Spring Boot + Spring Security + JWT

🗄️💾 Database: PostgreSQL

🌐 Integration: BMS client for bank operations

Installations(Running the Project Locally)
🛠️ Prerequisites
Java 17+

Maven or Gradle

Node.js 18+ & npm / yarn

any database server like PostgreSQL 14+, MySQL,

(Optional) Docker for DB setup

🔧 Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

Create PostgreSQL DB
create db lms

Or using Docker
docker run --name lms-postgres
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
-e POSTGRES_DB=lms
-p 5432:5432
-d postgres:14

Edit backend/src/main/resources/application.properties:

server.port=8081

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/lms

spring.datasource.username=postgres

spring.datasource.password=postgres

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

spring.jpa.show-sql=true

JWT Configuration
app.jwt.secret=your-secret-key app.jwt.expiration=86400000

Run the backend:
cd backend mvn spring-boot:run

💻 Frontend Setup (React + Vite)
cd frontend

npm install

npm run dev

Frontend: http://localhost:5173

Backend: http://localhost:8081

🌐 Environment Variables
Create .env in frontend/:

VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8081/api/lms
VITE_PUBLIC_BASE=http://localhost:8081
🔄 Key Flows
1️⃣ Bank Verification
→ LMS → BMS → Micro-deposit → Verification → Credit Score Update

2️⃣ Loan Application
→ Check verified bank → Calculate EMI → Save as PENDING → Update credit score

3️⃣ Admin Approval
→ Fetch BMS snapshot → Approve → LMS disburses loan → EMI schedule generated

4️⃣ Loan Repayment
→ Repayment via BMS → LMS updates EMI & credit score

📡 API Reference

🪙 Bank Management System (BMS)
A demo banking microservice built using Spring Boot that integrates with LMS via JWT-secured APIs.
Features:
REST APIs for micro-deposits, loan disbursements, repayments

JWT authentication & secure ngrok tunneling

Handles account verification & transaction tracking

BMS Endpoints
GET /api/bank/hello GET Health check
GET /api/bank/verify Send micro-deposit
POST /api/bank/verify-deposit Confirm micro-deposit
POST /api/bank/loan Disburse loan
POST /api/bank/repay Repay loan amount
🗂️ Database Schema (High Level)
users → Stores customer & admin profiles

bank_account → Bank verification status

loan_application → Pending loan requests

loan → Approved loans & EMI details

loan_emi_schedule → EMI tracking per loan

repayment → Loan repayments

credit_score → Customer credit scoring

⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Fixes
CORS Issues → Add Spring CorsConfig

400 on Password Update → Use protected API client

Wrong Dates → Check appliedDate in backend response
